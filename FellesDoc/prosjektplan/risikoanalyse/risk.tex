\hline
Risk & Prob\newline
ability & Degree of severity & Consequences & Retirement plan \\ \hline
Illness/Absence caused by external factors & Moderate & Serious & Affected
individual is unable to complete their tasks & Participant's tasks must be
carried out by other participans \\ \hline
Late discovery of errors & High & Tolerable & Development slows down or halts
& Backtrack to the error's origin and correct affected areas \\ \hline
A task takes longer than expected & Moderate & Tolerable & Results in more
work than expected and possibly delayed progress & Alter the project plan,
distribute tasks to participants \\ \hline
Technical difficulties & Low & Serious & Planned solution is possibly
invalidated & Fix the technical issue or use another solution \\ \hline
The project is halted due to lack of knowledge & Low & Tolerable & 
Participant does not have the required knowledge to complete a task & 
Attempt to learn from team members, read up on subject material \\ \hline
Loss of group members & Low & Critical & Activities are left without
supervisor & Divide tasks amongst remaining participants \\ \hline
Internal disagreements & Low & Tolerable & Time is spent on discussions
rather than development & Maintain democracy and motivational levels \\ 
\hline
Change in specifications & Low & Tolerable & Both planned and implemented
solutions are invalidated & Discuss changes with student/teaching assistant
\\ \hline
