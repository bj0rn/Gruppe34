\section{Scenarios}

\subsection{Scenario 1}

An employee has invited three business associates to a meet \&\ greet at the
offices of Company X.\ The employee adds this as an appointment in his
calendar, and uses the calendar-system to book an available conference room
spacious enough for four people.

\subsection{Scenario 2}

...

\section{Tasks}

\section{Procedure}

The prototype was tested on several members members from group 32. The tests
were conducted by members of group 34.

\section{Results}

After completing the tests and discussing our different designs with group
32, some design-flaws and absent features were revealed to us.

M\aa\ skille mellom feil og problemer.

EProblem =\ feil.

EProblem: The room-reservation dialogue has no "cancel"\ button.

Reason:\ Oversight.

Fix:\ Add a "cancel"\ button.

\bigskip

Problem:\ The location-field in the create/edit meeting/appointment dialogue
window felt ambiguous.

Reason:\ The [...]-button in the location-field.

Fix:\ Seperate the location field and the [...]\ (book-a-room) and remove
any ambiguity as to whether one can use both.

\bigskip 

EProblem: Calendar-view does not display the date.

Reason:\ Oversight.

Fix:\ Add the week's dates to the calendar-view.

\bigskip 

Problem:\ Confusion regarding at what time a day begins.

Reason:\ The scrollbar on the right side of the calendar is shown being
scrolled all the way up but the earliest time shown is 07:00.

Fix:\ yep
